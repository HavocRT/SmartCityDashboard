Smart City Dashboard

# description
A **smart city** is an urban area that uses IoT, sensors and data analytics to manage assets, resources and services efficiently.

The **Smart City Dashboard** website aims to show how the dashboard of a smart city looks and functions, by providing meaningful information provided by a backend and displayed using a well-structured frontend.

The primary inspiration for this project is taken from the EDAG group in Germany that provides a smart city dashboard reference of what to expect and how a dashboard for a smart city is supposed to look like.
